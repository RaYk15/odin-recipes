Hello, my name is Marcos, I recently started studying web programming by myself and I'm following The Odin Project course.
In this project, I'll be making a cooking website, which will include various recipes within itself.
The objective of this project is to create a functioning website, even if its just the bare bones in html, and to get
confortable using resources such as including hyperlinks, lists, images, etc... Really basic things but most important
nonetheless.
