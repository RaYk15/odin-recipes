    <p>I know it's a bit weird to start off with a dessert, but this is the last recipe of the bunch that I prepared myself, so that's that.
       Also I cannot get enough cheesecake, I love it.<br>
       This recipe in particular doesn't have the usual red fruit jam, nor the cookie base. That's because I prefer it this way. Not that it matters, you can throw it in if you like it, it'll taste great anyways. <br>
       Let's get started with the recipe!
    </p>
    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>560g cream cheese</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>230g sugar</li>
        <li>285ml cooking cream</li>
        <li>10g flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>UTENSILS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cooking whiskers</li>
        <li>Round mold</li>
        <li>Mixing bowl</li>
        <li>Oven paper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>PREPARATION</h3>
    <ol>

        <li>Cover the mold with the oven paper (to make this easier you can lightly damp the paper), and pour the mix into the bowl, over the paper.</li>
        <li>Into the oven it goes. 40 mins at 200 degrees with heat over and under.</li>
        <li>Let it rest for a few hours and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>That's it, easy as pie. Get it??<br>
    The recipe in itself is super easy. It should take you around 10 mins of getting the right measurements and mixing and the 40 mins in the oven that you can do whatever.<br>
    Hope you enjoyed this cheesecake recipe for dummies, stay tunned.</p>
