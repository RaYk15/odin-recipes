    <h1>Cheesecake</h1>
    <p>I know it's a bit weird to start off with a dessert, but this is the last recipe of the bunch that I prepared myself, so that's that.
       Also I cannot get enough cheesecake, I love it, so let's get started with this.
    </p>

    </ul>
    <h3>UTENSILS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cooking whiskers</li>
        <li>Round mold</li>
        <li>Mixing bowl</li>
        <li>Oven paper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>PREPARATION</h3>

    <p>That's it, easy as pie. Get it??<br>
    The recipe in itself is super easy. It should take you arround 10 mins of getting the right measurements and mixing and the 40 mins in the oven that you can do whatever.<br>
    Anyways, hope you enjoyed this recipe for dummies, stay tunned.</p>
