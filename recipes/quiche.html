    <p>Love me a salty pie, it has the best of both worlds. Super tasty, easy to eat and to ration, looks great... Incredible dish overall. <br>
    I would say this is the "hardest" recipe of the bunch I chose, but just because you have to prepare the dough mold first on the one hand, and then the filling on the other. <br>
    Even though, when you get to the cooking itself, just follow the recipe and you can't get it wrong. <br>
    Let's get to it!</p>
    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
    <h4>For the dough</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>250g wheat flour</li>
        <li>125g butter</li>
        <li>A pinch of salt</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk</li>
        <li>2 spoons of cold water</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the filling</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>200g bacon</li>
        <li>500ml cooking cream</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>150g emmental cheese</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>White pepper</li>
        <li>Grounded nutmeg</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>UTENSILS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Mixing bowl</li>
        <li>Round mold</li>
        <li>Rolling pin</li>
        <li>Oven paper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>PREPARATION</h3>
    <h4>For the dough</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the flour and the butter (diced) in the mixing bowl with the pinched salt.</li>
        <li>Mix it with your fingers until it gets a sandy texture.</li>
        <li>Add the egg yolk and the water and mix without working the dough too much. Until the dough doesn't stick to the bowl.</li>
        <li>Wrap it in film and let it rest in the refrigerator for 30 mins.</li>
        <li>Take it out, stretch with the rolling pin and put the dough over the mold (previously oiled with butter and flour). </li>
        <li>Put the oven paper over the dough, and put some weight on it so it doesn't rise (i.e. chickpeas or some other legume you have at home).</li>
        <li>Bake in the oven for 10 mins at 180 degrees. Heat over and under.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>For the filling</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Dice the bacon.</li>
        <li>Fry the bacon in a pan.</li>
        <li>Mix in the bowl the cooking cream and the eggs.</li>
        <li>Grate the emmental cheese and mix it in the bowl.</li>
        <li>Season the mix with salt, white pepper, and nutmeg.</li>
        <li>Take the dough out of the oven, take off the weight, and pour the mix into the dough.</li>
        <li>Finally, bake it in the oven for 30 mins at 180 degrees with heat over and under.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>That's it, now you wait for the quiche to cool down and serve. <br>
    I haven't made this dish in a super long time, maybe it's time I do it again, I'm incredibly hungry now that I think about it. <br>
    Hope you enjoyed the recipe. Being the one that's a bit harder, I also think it's the most fun to prepare out of the bunch. I recommend you try cooking it with your partner, all lovey-dovey. <br>
    Anyways, enjoy and stay tuned!</p>
