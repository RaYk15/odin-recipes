    <p>What can I say about this clasic dish, I just love italian cooking. I like rice, I like cheese, and I like mushrooms, and this dish lets all those ingredients shine.<br>
    The key for this recipe is to be patient, let the rice take its time to absorb all the flavours and get that signature creamy texture of the risotto. <br>
    Let's get started with this.</p>
    <div class="index">
    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>40g butter</li>
        <li>Half an onion</li>
        <li>250g mushrooms, clean and chopped</li>
        <li>350g risotto rice</li>
        <li>200ml white wine</li>
        <li>1L chicken (or vegetable) broth</li>
        <li>100g parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>UTENSILS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A big frying pan</li>
        <li>Whatever can stir the ingredients and doesn't scratch the pan</li>
        <li>Grater</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>PREPARATION</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Throw the butter in the pan at low heat.</li>
        <li>Chop the onion in small pieces, then cook them with the butter until transparent.</li>
        <li>Throw the mushrooms in the pan and cook them for around 5 mins at medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the rice into the pan and mix it so it captures all the flavours.</li>
        <li>Pour the wine and wait until it evaporates.</li>
        <li>Pour the broth little by little as the rice absorbs it, with the help of a ladle or a glass.<br>
            It's important that the broth is very hot when we add it, so the rice keeps on cooking. <br>
            This can take up to 20 mins, so be patient, and keep on stirring.</li>
        <li>When the rice is done, turn off the heat and add the grated parmesan cheese. Stir until mixed.</li>
        <li>Finally serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <p>When you order a risotto in a restaurant, it may seem like a complicated dish to make from the outside. In reality it just takes around 40 mins and a bit of patience. <br>
    Even then, I messed up big time this recipe the first time I tried it. <br>
    Long story short, I was drinking with my girlfriend while cooking, and mixed the broth with my vodka drink. Ended up cooking the rice with vodka. <br>
    For no ones surprise, it tasted horribly. Hope you don't make your risotto slavic style while following this recipe. <br>
    Stay tuned!</p>
