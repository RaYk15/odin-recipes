    <h1>Odin Recipes</h1>
    <h2>First project on The Odin Project Curriculum</h2>
    <p>Hi, I have little to no idea about cooking or recipes, but that doesn't mean
       I can't make a list with the <em>unfathomable</em> ammount of dishes that I love with
       all my heart. In this silly project I will try to make a website containing
       some selected few of that list, and craft a comprehensive recipe for all of
       you to enjoy.</p>
